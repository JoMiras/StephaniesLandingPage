Hello!
This was really just a landing page that I created because we were hosting a party for Stephanie's birthday party!!!! 
The project had a timeline of just 3 hours, just in time for the party to start and to have a QR code linked to the website. 
Not my best work but I thoroughly enjoyed making this!
